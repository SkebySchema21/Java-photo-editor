# Java photo processor

This is a photo processor that is made in Eclipse, to showcase different aspects of programming in Java, like:

- File manipulation
- Several OOP concepts
- How threads and pipes work

All of the files are contained in the Test.jar file. The application is a simple one: add the name of the image, after which a Prewitt operator is applied. However, different effects can be easily added, just by adding new process functions to the Prewitt class.
